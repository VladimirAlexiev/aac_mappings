        %p 
          This page contains reference material for the AAC Mappings for the browse application.  
          These mappings are slightly different than the mappings that ISI is doing—those are mappings from institutional data to RDF, using the CIDOC-CRM ontology.   
        %p
          These mappings are for the RDF to the browse application, or to other applications.  We are interested in verifying that the information that was entered is retrievable in a consistent, regular fashion.
        %p
          Below are mapping for the fields of each of our core entities. There is also a series of FAQs displayed, describing common questions about LOD and our mappings, and when possible recording our consensus of AAC 'good practices'.
