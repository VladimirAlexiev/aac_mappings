title: Where should AAC-created vocabularies be hosted?

category: Triplestores, RDF, and Inferencing

### Problem Statement:

As part of the AAC work, we may create a collection of LOD URIs to describe AAC-specific concepts.  At what URL will these be hosted, and how will they be documented?

### Best Practice:

Our current practice is to avoid creating LOD URIs for the AAC if at all possible.  If and when we determine that we need to reference a concept that we have been unable to locate an existing URI for, we will discuss with the [Getty AAT](http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/aat) to determine if that concept is appropriate for that thesaurus. 

If it is decided that the term is inappropriate, we will identify an AAC partner willing to host that term as part of their internal vocabulary, and reconcile our use of that term to that URI.

During the development of the AAC, it is acceptable to use placeholder terms with AAC urls, knowing that these will have to be removed before the project is complete.

### Discussion:

*(from conference call, 9/28/2016)*

Vocabularies that are not currently available externally?

* Manage ourselves? Or provide to Getty to incorporate into AAT?
* For types and other kinds of contextual terms
* RS: Terms for predicates rather than terms for classes?

**DECISION:**

* Longer-term: EF / RS: Ask for this from the Getty? YES
* Short-term: Batch up the terms into a simple file to be matched. Hold the terms under an AAC URL, recognizing they will need to change as a batch late in the project, when Getty (or someone) is able to receive them.
