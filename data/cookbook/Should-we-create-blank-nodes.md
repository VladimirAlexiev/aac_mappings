*(From Rob)*

Avoid if at all possible.  Just because we can’t think of a reason to refer to a node from an external source doesn’t mean that there isn’t a reason to do so.  As we’re generating millions of URIs regardless, we might as well do it for all of our resources.  Discussing which resources can be blank nodes would take longer than just assigning them all URIs :)

*(From Vladimir)*

Don't use them :-) You can always make a URL (doesn't take a lot of
creativity), and that helps debugging immensely.
Haven't seen a blank node come out of Karma.
