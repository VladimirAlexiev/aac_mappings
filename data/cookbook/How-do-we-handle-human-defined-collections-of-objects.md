I think that would be valuable, especially for exhibitions (including multiple stops), as they would serve multiple purposes:
  — provide links between resources from different institutions that otherwise might not be connected
  — provide a discovery mechanism across institutions
  — exercise both CRM and IIIF
  — hopefully expose some of the work done for the exhibition in terms of curation

From my experience with Archiving (we're in the EHRI project), these above are very different animals.
There's no good semantic model of EAD (the XML archival standard). I know about two, but each has its problems.

It would definitely be great to discover Exhibitions that showed objects from the different museums. But first we'd need to coreference exhibitions across museums. I'm not aware of any work in that direction, or a global register of exhibitions.

Overall on the above question, I think it should be addressed from the "browse app requirements" point of view.

Agreed.  Let’s not derail the discussion by looking at archival practices and RDF! Maybe over beer in October? :)
