### Best Practice:

*To Be Determined*

### Discussion:

*(From Vladimir)*

And where AAT is lacking, we have 2 options:

- ask Patricia Harpring to add. She's been doing this actively for the JPGM mapping.  E.g. she added first name, last name, title, suffix, preferred
identifier...but she won't add overly technical concepts like "exhibition at a venue" (whereas "traveling exhibition" is already included).
- Establish an AAC (NOT museum-specific!) micro-thesaurus, call it "AAC
terminology"
