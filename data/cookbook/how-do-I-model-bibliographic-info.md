### Problem Statement

How do we model bibliographic information?

### Best Practice:

*To Be Determined*

### Discussion:

See mapping from Vladimir in [NPG issue #55](https://github.com/american-art/npg/issues/55)

*(From Rob, via email, 9/19/2016)*

I think using CRM for modeling bibliographic references is using a sledgehammer to drive in a screw, when there's a whole toolbox full of different screwdrivers available. It's just the wrong tool for the job.
