### Problem Statement:

### Best Practice:

*To Be Determined*

### Discussion:

*(From Rob)*

(delete rant about ULAN modeling) I suggest <http://lexvo.org/ontology#isFocusOf> (inverse of foaf:focus) And I have suggested (several times) that this should be in ULAN and TGN natively.


*(From Vladimir)*

The best is to use the ulan:nnnn-agent URL directly.
You could make statements about it (e.g. names coming from local data) in your repository.  Of course, if you want to analyze which data about agents came from which institution, then you need own URLs, and can connect them with sameAs.

### Reference:

* <http://lexvo.org/ontology#isFocusOf>
