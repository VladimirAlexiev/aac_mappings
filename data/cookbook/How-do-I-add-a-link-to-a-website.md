### Problem Statement:

Within the AAC data there are links to existing websites, such as the institution's collections site, wikipedia article about the party, or other human-readable resources that exist at URLs. 

What is the RDF pattern that indicates a link to the website as well as metadata about that link, such as a title?

### Best Practice:

*To Be Determined*

### Discussion:

Use Case: How do I go from the AAC data about an object back to the collections page on the institution website?

Also, I'm happy to foaf:page it up here, but that only handles the link, not the *text of the link*.  As in, for <a href="URL">LINK TEXT</a>, I can get the URL, but how do I get the LINK TEXT?


*(From Rob)*

Use case?  That said, the foaf or schema equivalents seem much better to me than the very very loose p1 and p48
